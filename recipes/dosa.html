    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Urad Dal (split black gram)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water as needed</li>
        <li>Oil or Ghee for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in a bowl with enough water to cover them. In another bowl, soak the urad dal separately. Let them soak for at least 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain the soaked rice and fenugreek seeds, reserving the water. Similarly, drain the urad dal, reserving its water as well.</li>
        <li>Grind the urad dal using a wet grinder or a high-speed blender, adding a little reserved water as needed, until you get a smooth and fluffy batter. Transfer it to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Next, grind the rice and fenugreek seeds in the same way, adding reserved water as needed, until you get a slightly coarse batter. Combine this with the urad dal batter in the large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and mix the batter well. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter â€“ not too thick or too runny.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a clean cloth and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become slightly bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once fermented, stir the batter gently. If it's too thick, you can add a little water to adjust the consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or cast-iron tawa over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil or ghee.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the skillet and spread it out in a circular motion to form a thin dosa.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the edges start to lift and the bottom turns golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Flip the dosa and cook for another minute if you prefer it slightly crispy on both sides (optional).</li>
        <li>Remove the dosa from the skillet and serve hot with chutney, sambar, or your favorite accompaniments.</li>
